<h2>Iterating over arrays</h2>

<h5 id="processing-arrays-using-loops">Processing Arrays Using Loops</h5><p>It's quite useful to process an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3511" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An array in Java is a collection of elements of the same type, stored in memory sequentially and processed as a single unit. | It has a predefined size during creation, which cannot be changed in the future. Arrays are initialized with default values of their type, and their elements can be accessed using an index, starting from 0 and up to the array size minus 1.">array</a> by going through it with a loop. The <code class="language-java">length</code> property of an array can help you avoid an <code class="language-java">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>.</p><p>You can fill an array with the square of its element's index. The example below shows how:</p><pre><code class="language-java">int n = 10; // the size of an array
int[] squares = new int[n]; // creating an array with the specified size

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(squares)); // [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

/* iterating over the array */
for (int i = 0; i &lt; squares.length; i++) {
    squares[i] = i * i; // set the value by the element index 
}

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(squares)); // [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]</code></pre><p>The code above creates a ten-element array, initially all zeros. Then it sets each element's value to the square of its index. It turns the array into a string, displaying all elements inside square brackets and print this string on the screen.</p><p>Next, let's see how to use a loop to check an array's elements order.</p><p>The program below verifies if the provided array is sorted in ascending order. It prints "OK" if it is, and "BROKEN" if not.</p><pre><code class="language-java">int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 6 }; // the order is broken

boolean broken = false; // suppose the array is well-ordered

/* iterating over the array */
for (int i = 1; i &lt; numbers.length; i++) {
    
    if (numbers[i] &lt; numbers[i - 1]) { // if the order is broken
        broken = true; // write a result
        break;         // terminate the loop
    }
}

if (broken) {
    System.out.println("BROKEN");
} else {
    System.out.println("OK");
}</code></pre><p>In this program, for the provided array, the output is <code class="language-java">"BROKEN"</code>.</p><p>You can also use while and do-while loops for array <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3574" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Iteration in Java refers to the process of repeatedly executing a block of code until a specific condition is met. | This is typically accomplished through loops, which are control structures that enable the program to cycle through a series of statements multiple times. Java offers various loop types, such as while, do-while, for, and for-each loops, each designed to cater to different use cases and scenarios.

The initialization part is executed once at the beginning of the loop, the condition part is evaluated before each iteration to determine whether to continue the loop, and the modification part is executed at the end of each iteration to update the loop variable.">for-loop</a> known as <strong>for-each</strong>. It's used to iterate through each element of an array, string, or collection. With it, you don't have to deal with <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3511" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An index in Java is a numerical value that is used to access a specific element within an array or a collection. | It is essentially a position or location that is assigned to each element in a sequential manner, starting from zero.

Understanding the different types in Java is essential for writing correct and efficient code, as well as for understanding the behavior of existing code.">type</a> <code class="language-java">type</code> in the array <code class="language-java">array</code>, execute the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9955" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a statement is a unit of code that performs a specific action. | It is a complete instruction that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Statements are often used to declare variables, assign values, control the flow of a program, or call methods. They are typically terminated by a semicolon (;) and can be organized into blocks to define the scope and visibility of variables and methods. Understanding statements is crucial for writing clear and concise Java code.">statements</a> in the body.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at the components. <code class="language-java">type</code> specifies the variable type that will store one array element during each iteration.

The <code class="language-java">var</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a variable is a named storage location that is used to store a value of a specific type. | It is declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of value that can be stored in it. Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their values can be accessed and modified throughout the program.">variable</a> holds one array element in each iteration. Its value changes with each iteration to store the next element.</p><p>Let's now compute the number of <code class="language-java">'a'</code> letters in a given <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3522" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a character is a single symbol, denoted with a single quote, that can represent a letter, digit, whitespace, or other symbols. | It is actually an integer type that stores the Unicode integer value of each character, which is why character literals can be used as integers if needed.

The for-each loop works by automatically handling the iteration process, allowing developers to focus on the code within the loop body. This loop is particularly useful for iterating over arrays or collections where the order of elements is not crucial.">for-each loop</a></strong>:</p><pre><code class="language-java">char[] characters = { 'a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'a' };

    if (characters[i] == 'a') {
        counter++;
    }
}

System.out.println(counter); // it outputs "3"</code></pre><p>The for-each loop does have some limitations. You can't use it to modify an array because the variable we use for iterations doesn't hold the actual array element, only a copy. You also can't retrieve an element by its index as the index isn't used. Lastly, we can't move through an array with more than one step per iteration: we iterate through each element one-by-one.</p><p>The lack of indices makes the code more readable. The for-each loop also helps us avoid a <code class="language-java">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>. These benefits make it a popular choice for array iteration.</p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>Using loops is a convenient way to handle an array of elements.
